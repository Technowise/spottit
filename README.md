# Spottit
This is a game of spotting things in a posted picture. The app adds ability to create picture posts where post creator can mark specific spots of interest in the picture and then ask other users to find that spot (with a short description of what to find) in the picture. The post creator has to also mention the duration for the game/post, after which the game ends, and the results will be shown to all. Each participant's time taken to find the spot is recorded, so whoever finds the spot in shortest duration wins. Participants have max of 10 attempts to find the spot by default(this can be altered by the post creator). After the game ends, the leader-board will contain time taken by each participant in ascending order. This is an app developed using Reddit app Developer Platform.
