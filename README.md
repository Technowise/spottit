# Spottit
This is a game of spotting things in a posted picture. The app adds ability to create picture posts where post creator can mark specific spots in the picture and then ask other users to find that spot. This game is inspired by /r/FindTheSniper subreddit. Each participant's time taken to find the spot is measured, so leaderboard ranking is based on the time taken to find the spot. Those who wish to view the solution/spot can click on the eye icon - this will also abort the game for that participant. This is an app developed using Reddit app Developer Platform.
