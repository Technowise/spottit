New todo:
1. Implement a loading stage with loading indicator, where image is loaded in background (hidden and not shown), only start the timer after the image is shown.
2. Implement golbal ranking leaderboard.

1. After user aborts game, if refresh the view, it again shows 'Resume' option in the game. Make sure to not show Resume option once it is aborted. - Done
2. For archived posts (older than 1 month), show proper indication of the expired post. Inform user that the entry would not be included in the leaderboard.
3. Reduce the tile-size to 1/2 of the present size so that we can mark things that are closer by as separate spots, and make provision to mark spots within the web-view (instead of the present blocks view)
4. Allow moderators to delete faulty entries in leader-board.
5. Make it impossible to have a negative score. - Done
6. Find out how number of spots found sometimes goes greater than the actual number of spots.
